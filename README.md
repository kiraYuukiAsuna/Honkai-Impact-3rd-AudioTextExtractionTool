# Honkai-Impact-3rd-AudioTextExtractionTool
A tool that help your build relationship between audio filename and character name as well as audio text. Then you can export to Json and do other things.

## How to use
Notice: this only apply to version 6.7 and before.
- You need to get the decrypted settings and other data files in ***\AppData\LocalLow\***. For legitimate reasons, i won't provide these files. You need get it by yourself.
- Then just change the directory of those files. And simply run this program. Hopefully you can see the exproted result files.
- Althought I cannot provide you with the decrypted files to extract the Audio and Text, I can give you the final result Json files. You can check 'JsonResult' folder in the root directory of this repo.
